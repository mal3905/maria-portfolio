                <p>I was introduced into the world of coding through my former career as a 
                biomedical researcher. My job involved creating thousands of data points 
                each week and trying to analyze them in spreadsheets was not cutting it for
                 me. This made me dig more into the world of coding and I go hooked!</p>

                <p>My passion for creativity made me realize that a career as a web
                developer was the right path for me, which would allow my creative side 
                to keep developing. I took a leap of faith and joined a Thinkful, an engineer 
                immersive bootcamp that has allowed me to expand my knowledge and skill in software 
                engineering.</p>
                
                <p>I also have other passions as a novice in the world of photography, cooking 
                for my family,  and disk golf has become a regular sport for me.</p>
